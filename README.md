Overview:
Hospital readmissions, especially among patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, present a significant challenge to healthcare systems. These readmissions often indicate gaps in patient management, treatment adherence, or early intervention. Reducing unnecessary readmissions not only improves patient outcomes but also reduces the strain on medical resources and hospital infrastructure.
This project aims to use data-driven techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted. The model will identify high-risk patients, uncover the most influential factors contributing to readmission, and suggest actionable interventions that hospitals can implement to prevent avoidable returns.
